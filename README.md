This script is a Python tool for automating the Chrome browser using Selenium WebDriver. It sets up a Chrome browser instance, configures it to run in debugging mode, and then automates certain tasks by interacting with web pages.

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Operating System Handling: It detects the operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS) to determine the appropriate commands for starting Chrome with remote debugging.

SSO Class:

setupLogger(): Configures logging for the tool.
runChromeWithDebugging(): Starts a Chrome instance in debugging mode with a specified user data directory.
setupChromeDriver(): Sets up a Chrome WebDriver instance, connecting it to the Chrome instance running in debugging mode.
automateChrome(): Navigates the WebDriver to a specific URL (https://issues-pdx.amazon.com/issues/bulk-create in this case) to automate actions on the web page.
closeBrowser(): Closes the Chrome WebDriver instance.
getUserDataDir(): Generates a temporary directory path to store user data for the Chrome instance.

main(): The main function of the script. It initializes the SSO automation, sets up logging, runs Chrome with debugging, sets up the Chrome WebDriver, automates tasks in Chrome, and finally closes the browser.

Overall, this tool can be used for automating tasks that involve interactions with web pages, specifically targeting Chrome browsers, and is designed to work on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS). It's particularly useful for web scraping, testing, or any other automation tasks requiring interaction with web interfaces.
